BIT MANIPULATION
This folder contains code that performs various bitwise operations as follows bellow:
1. 0-binary_to_uint.c: changes binary value to unsigned integer
2. 1-print_binary.c: prints the binary representation of a number
3. 2-get_bit.c: gets the value of a bit at a given index
4. 3-set_bit.c: sets the value of a bit a t a given index
5. 4-clear_bit.c: sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index
6. 5-flip_bits.c: returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one given number to another
